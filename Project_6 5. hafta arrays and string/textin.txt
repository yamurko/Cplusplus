	The birth of the personal computer in the 1970s, the graphical
 user interface in the 1980s, the World Wide Web in the 1990s
 and today the 'Internet of Things' have launched our global
 society into the so-called 'information age'. For a small
 group of people it is their daily job to think consciously
 about what this actually means: scholars, hackers, artists,
 active bloggers and some politicians have looked,
 for instance, at how democracy, capitalism, solidarity,
 intimacy or the sense of physical presence work in a digital environment.
